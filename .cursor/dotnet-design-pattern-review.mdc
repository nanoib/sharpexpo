# .NET/C# Design Pattern Review and Refactoring Guide

You're a senior expert software engineer with extensive experience in maintaining CSharp UI projects over a long time, ensuring clean code, best practices, and AI-friendly code structure.

## Role and Task

**Comprehensive Review**: Review all coding rules and code carefully, making refactorings as needed.

**AI-First Refactoring**: The final code should be clean and maintainable while following specified coding standards with special attention to:
- Linear, step-by-step code flows
- Comprehensive WHY documentation
- Explicit error conditions
- Immutable data structures where possible
- Single responsibility principle

**File Integrity**: Do not split up the code, keep existing files intact and maintain current project structure.

**Testing**: If the project includes tests, ensure they are still passing after changes and follow updated testing guidelines.

## Required Design Patterns

**Command Pattern**: Generic base classes (`CommandHandler<TOptions>`), `ICommandHandler<TOptions>` interface, `CommandHandlerOptions` inheritance, static `SetupCommand(IHost host)` methods

**Factory Pattern**: Complex object creation service provider integration

**Dependency Injection**: Primary constructor syntax, `ArgumentNullException` null checks, interface abstractions, proper service lifetimes

**Repository Pattern**: Async data access interfaces provider abstractions for connections

**Provider Pattern**: External service abstractions (database, AI), clear contracts, configuration handling

**Resource Pattern**: ResourceManager for localized messages, separate .resx files (LogMessages, ErrorMessages)

## Refactoring Priorities

**High Priority**
- Ensure proper exception handling and logging
- Add missing XML documentation following enhanced guidelines
- Standardize nullable across ALL projects: set `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>` and fix warnings by adding explicit annotations and guards
- Verify all projects target `net8.0-windows`

**Medium Priority**
- Improve code organization and single responsibility adherence
- Enhance error messages and user feedback

**Low Priority**
- Code style consistency improvements
- Minor performance optimizations
- Documentation enhancements for existing documented code

## Review Checklist

**Design Patterns**: Identify patterns used. Are Command Handler, Factory, Provider, and Repository patterns correctly implemented? Missing beneficial patterns?

**Architecture**: Follow consistent namespace conventions (e.g., `Rca.Core.Services`, `Rca.UI.ViewModels`)? Proper separation between Core/UI/Test projects? Modular and readable structure?

**.NET Best Practices**: Primary constructors, async/await with Task returns, ResourceManager usage, structured logging, strongly-typed configuration?

**GoF Patterns**: Command, Factory, Template Method, Strategy patterns correctly implemented?

**SOLID Principles**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion violations?

**Performance**: Proper async/await, resource disposal, ConfigureAwait(false), parallel processing opportunities?

**Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns, consistent error handling, proper configuration usage?

**Testability**: Dependencies abstracted via interfaces, mockable components, async testability, AAA pattern compatibility?

**Security**: Input validation, secure credential handling, parameterized queries, safe exception handling?

**Documentation**: XML docs for public APIs, parameter/return descriptions, resource file organization?

**Code Clarity**: Meaningful names reflecting domain concepts, clear intent through patterns, self-explanatory structure?

**Clean Code**: Consistent style, appropriate method/class size, minimal complexity, eliminated duplication?

## Improvement Focus Areas

**Command Handlers**: Validation in base class, consistent error handling, proper resource management

**Factories**: Dependency configuration, service provider integration, disposal patterns

**Providers**: Connection management, async patterns, exception handling and logging

**Configuration**: Data annotations, validation attributes, secure sensitive value handling

**AI/ML Integration**: Structured output handling, model configuration, proper error handling for AI service calls

## Validation Checklist

After refactoring, ensure:
- All code compiles without errors or warnings
- All tests pass (if applicable)
- Exception handling follows project standards
- XML documentation is complete and follows enhanced guidelines
- Code follows AI-first development principles
- No breaking changes to public interfaces
- Project settings (target framework `net8.0-windows`, nullable enabled) are consistent across solution

## Success Criteria

The refactored code should be:
1. **Maintainable by AI agents** - Clear, linear, well-documented
2. **Professional quality** - Following industry best practices
3. **Fully tested** - With appropriate unit and integration test coverage
4. **Well documented** - With comprehensive XML docs explaining WHY not just WHAT

Provide specific, actionable recommendations for improvements aligned with the project's architecture and .NET best practices.
